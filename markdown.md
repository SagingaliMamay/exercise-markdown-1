# Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 

## Description
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.



## Purpose
John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.
Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. 

## Ex of Markdown code

If you want to write in **BOLD** use:
'** text here **' and the text between the stars will be bold
